# CMAKE-OpenGL-Template
This is a CMake OpenGL template originally made in CLION, but it can be used across many different text editors if needed. This project is primarily designed for beginners who are learning practical configuration design patterns. You can also use this project if you don't feel like downloading everything separately.
